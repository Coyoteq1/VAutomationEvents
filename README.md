[Command("mycommand", adminOnly: false, usage: ".mycommand [args]")]
public static void MyCustomCommand(ChatCommandContext ctx, string args = "")
{
    try
    {
        // Your custom command logic here
        ctx.Reply("✅ Custom command executed successfully!");
        
        // Example: Get player info
        var player = ctx.Event.SenderUserEntity.GetUserSafely(VAutoCore.EntityManager);
        ctx.Reply($"👋 Hello {player.CharacterName}!");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Plugin.Instance.Log?.LogError($"Error in custom command: {ex.Message}");
        ctx.Reply("❌ Command failed. Check logs for details.");
    }
}
Command Attributes:
[Command("name", ...)] - Defines the command name and parameters
adminOnly: false/true - Controls who can use the command
usage: ".command [args]" - Shows help text
Console Integration:
